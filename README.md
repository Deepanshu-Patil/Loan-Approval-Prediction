Loan Approval Prediction
This project predicts loan approval status based on various customer attributes using Python. The aim is to build a machine learning model that can analyze the given data and determine the likelihood of loan approval for new applicants.

Project Overview
In this project, we use data related to loan applicants, such as income, credit history, loan amount, and other relevant features, to train a model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not. This can help financial institutions make more informed decisions when assessing loan applications.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Model Training: Implements various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes model performance using techniques like GridSearchCV.
Deployment-Ready Code: Contains a script to make predictions on new data.
